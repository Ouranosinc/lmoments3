Python 3 compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Python package was further updated to make it compatible with Python 3.x by Florenz A.P. Hollebrandse
<f.a.p.hollebrandse@protonmail.ch>.

The software remains licenced under the GNU General Public License, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.

The Python 3 port, is based on the original `lmoments package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lmoments/0.2.2>`_, version
0.2.2.

The Ouranosinc package was forked from `OpenHydrology's lmoments3 <https://github.com/OpenHydrology/lmoments3>`_.
The primary aims of this fork are to provide maintenance for the existing codebase as well as update the project to
benefit from more modern Python coding conventions, maintain compatibility with existing Python dependencies.
